  abstract = {One well-studied model of a multiprocessing system involves a fixed number n of identical abstract processors, a finite set of tasks to be executed, each requiring a specified amount of computation time, and a partial ordering on the tasks which requires certain tasks to be completed before certain others can be initiated. The nonpreemptive operation of the system is guided by an ordered list L of the tasks, according to the rule that whenever a processor becomes idle, it selects for processing the  first unexecuted task on L which may validly be executed. We introduce an additional element of realism into this model by postulating the existence of a set of ``resources'' with the property that for each resource, the total usage of that resource at any instant of time may not exceed its total availability. For this augmented model, we determine upper bounds on the ratio of finishing times achieved using two different lists, L and \$L'\$, and exhibit constructions to show that the bounds are best possible.}

  abstract = {In 1969, Graham developed a well-known response time bound for a DAG task using the total workload and the longest path of the DAG, which has been widely applied to solve many scheduling and analysis problems of DAG-based task systems. This paper presents a new response time bound for a DAG task using the total workload and the lengths of multiple long paths of the DAG, instead of the longest path in Graham's bound. Our new bound theoretically dominates and empirically outperforms Graham's bound. We further extend the proposed approach to multi-DAG task systems. Our schedulability test theoretically dominates federated scheduling and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.},
